    <Question question='An archaeologist discovers a scroll containing a sequence of letters: A,G,C,T, and observes that they follow a DNA-like double helix pattern. The sequence encodes a set of geographic coordinates. However, the scroll notes that the sequence must first be transcribed using Morse code, then converted to binary, and finally analyzed using a formula for elliptical orbits in physics. Solve for the location and identify its historical significance.' answer='Giza' />
